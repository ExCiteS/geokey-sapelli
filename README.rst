geokey-sapelli
==============

Sapelli support in GeoKey. This extension enables user to upload decision trees and data via the admin interfaces.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

*Note:* This guide assumes you have a working `GeoKey <https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey>`_ installation.

1. Clone the repository:

.. code-block:: console

  git clone https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey-sapelli.git

2. Install the package:

.. code-block:: console

  cd geokey-sapelli
  pip install -e .

3. Go to your GeoKey installation and edit ``settings.py`` file (usually in ``local_settings\``) to add ``'geokey_sapelli',`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list.

4. Download the latest available version of the `Sapelli Collector CmdLn front-end <https://github.com/ExCiteS/Sapelli/releases>`_. The file you want looks like ``sapelli-collector-cmdln-X.X.X-XXXXXX-with-dependencies.jar``. You have 2 options regarding the installation of this ``jar`` file:

 - Rename the file to ``sapelli-collector-cmdln-with-dependencies.jar`` and place it in the ``geokey-sapelli/lib`` folder [*Recommended*];
 - or, place the file in a folder of your choice (you can rename it as well if you want) and again edit the above-mentioned ``settings.py`` file to add the *absolute* path to the file, like so: ``SAPELLI_JAR = '/path/to/sapelli-collector-cmdln-X.X.X-XXXXXX-with-dependencies.jar'``.

5. To use the extension via the API, first register a new OAuth application with Authorisation type *password*. You will then get the Client ID. Add the Client ID to your ``settings.py`` (usually in ``local_settings\``) as follows:

.. code-block:: console

  SAPELLI_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID'

6. Add the database tables:

.. code-block:: console

  python manage.py migrate geokey_sapelli

7. Run tests specific to this extension to ensure everything is correctly installed. Go to your GeoKey installation folder and run:

.. code-block:: console

  python manage.py test geokey_sapelli

8. Restart the server.

9. Open a browser and go to the ``/admin/sapelli/`` path on your GeoKey server (e.g. ``http://localhost:8080``). If you see a page titled "**Sapelli**" you have correctly installed the `geokey-sapelli extension <https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey-sapelli>`_.
